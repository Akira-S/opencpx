  <p>The Sent Items folder stores copies of outgoing messages.</p>
  <p>By default, Webmail does not automatically save copies of sent messages in your Sent Items folder.</p>
  <ol title="To enable this option for a single message: ">
    <li>After you compose your message, select the <em type="bold">Save a copy to Sent Items folder</em> check box.<p>
        <em type="bold">Note:</em> Be aware that attachments also are saved and that they affect your account disk space.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>Click <em type="bold">Send</em>. After a short pause, the Inbox window appears with a message informing you that your message was sent.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <ol title="To automatically save all sent messages in the Sent Items folder: ">
    <li><p>In the Webmail Options menu group, click <em type="bold">Outgoing Mail</em> (expand the menu group to see the links, if necessary).</p>
	<p>The Outgoing Mail Options window appears.</p>
    </li>
    <li>Next to Save Sent Mail, select <em type="bold">Yes, save a copy of all sent mail in the Sent Items folder</em>.<p>
        <em type="bold">Note:</em> Be aware that attachments also are saved and that they affect your account disk space.

    </li>
    <li>Click <em type="bold">Save</em>. A message appears informing you that your changes have been saved. Copies of all future sent messages will be saved in the Sent Items folder.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <ul title="From the Sent Items folder, you can perform the following tasks: ">
    <li>Open your email messages.</li>
