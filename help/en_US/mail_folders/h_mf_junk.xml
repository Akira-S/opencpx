  <p>The Junk folder is a system folder that receives unsolicited email messages from SpamAssassin; this folder cannot be renamed or deleted.</p>
  <p>You should regularly check the contents of the Junk folder before clearing it. Mail filtering is not a perfect science; you might find that some messages you wanted to receive have been filtered to the Junk folder.</p>
