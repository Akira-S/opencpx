  <title>Adding a Folder</title>
  <p>System Mail Folders (Inbox Drafts, Sent Items, Trash, Junk, and Quarantine) are used by the server for specific purposes and should not be renamed or deleted. However, you can create as many personal mail folders as you need. Folder names can be 1-150 alphanumeric characters in length and must be unique.</p>
  <ol title="To add a folder:">
    <li><p>In the Folder Management menu group, click <em type="bold">Add Folder</em> (expand the menu group to see the links, if necessary).</p>
	<p>The Add Folder window appears.</p>
    </li>
    <li>In the New Folder Name field, type the name you want for the new folder and click <em type="bold">Save</em> or  <em type="bold">Save/Create Another</em>. A message appears informing you that the folder has been created.</li>
  </ol>
