  <p>The Quarantine folder is a system folder that receives (from ClamAV) email messages whose attachments contain viruses; this folder cannot be renamed or deleted. You should clear this file periodically to prevent excessive disk space usage.</p>
  <ol title="To clear the Quarantine folder: ">
    <li><p>In the Folder Management menu group, click <em type="bold">Folder List</em> (expand the menu group to see the links, if necessary).</p>
	<p>The Folder List window appears.</p>
    </li>
    <li>Click <em type="bold">clear</em> for the Quarantine folder. A message appears informing you that the Quarantine folder has been cleared. The system moves the messages to the Trash folder.
