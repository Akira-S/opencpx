  <title>Adding a Domain Administrator</title>
  <p>
    <em type="bold">Note:</em>
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>If you enable the Mail privilege for your domain administrators, you create a mailbox on the server for them. Enabling the Mail privilege for domain administrators gives them an email address on the server domain, and an email address on all of the virtual host domains added to their account.</li>
    <li>If you enable FTP access for your domain administrators, you give them access to a personal home directory for file storage on the domain, and the ability to transfer files to and from the directory using an FTP client. Granting this privilege to domain administrators provides FTP access to the document root for each domain in their account.</li>
    <li>If you enable Shell access for your domain administrators, you allow them to access domain account functions on the server, using the command line interface through an SSH client or Telnet client.</li>
  </ul>
