  <title>Viewing Hidden Files</title>
  <p>Hidden files are typically system files kept out of view to help unclutter your directory contents. They are typically 
shown as .filetype, where filetype is the file extension of the hidden file.</p>
  <ol title="To view the hidden system files:">
    <li><p>In the File Management menu group, click <em type="bold">File List</em> (expand the menu group to see the links, if necessary). For more information about expanding and collapsing menu groups, see <a topic='menus_navigation'>Menus and Navigation</a>.</p>
	<p>The File List window appears.</p>
    </li>
    <li>At the right end of the Contents of row, click <em type="bold">XX Hidden Files</em> (where XX represents the number of files). The home page refreshes displaying the hidden files in the Directory Contents column.
    </li>
  </ol>
