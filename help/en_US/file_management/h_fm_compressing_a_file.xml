  <title>Compressing Files</title>
  <p>You should compress large files before storing them or using FTP to transfer them to another user. The user receiving the file would then un-compress the file. You can also compress several individual files into one file.</p>
  <ol title="To compress a file:">
    <li><p>In the File Management menu group, click <em type="bold">File List</em> (expand the menu group to see the links, if necessary). For more information about expanding and collapsing menu groups, see <a topic='menus_navigation'>Menus and Navigation</a>.</p>
	<p>The File List window appears.</p>
	</li>
    <li>If the name of the file you want to compress appears in the home directory, continue with the next step. If the file you want to compress is in another directory, click the name of that directory in the Directory Contents column. The directory contents appear.</li>
    <li>Click the checkbox for the file you want to compress.</li>
    <li>Click <em type="bold">Compress</em>. The Compress window appears.
    </li>
    <li>Type the name for the compressed file in the Compressed File Name field.</li>
    <li>Click the drop down-arrow to the right of the file name field to select the type of compression you want (zip, tar, taz, tbz, or tgz).</li>
    <li>If you want to save the compressed file in the directory that appears in the Destination Directory field, continue with the next step. If you want to select another destination directory, click the blue directory icon. The Destination Directory pop-up window appears. Browse to the directory name you want and click <em type="bold">Choose</em>. That directory name appears in the Destination Directory field.
    </li>
    <li>Click <em type="bold">OK</em>. The home page appears with a message informing you that the files were successfully compressed.
    </li>
  </ol>
