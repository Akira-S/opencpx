<ul title="Menu Groups"></ul>
<p>In the control panel, similar actions are grouped together in a module. Each menu group in the interface represents a corresponding module. Menu groups begin with the module title, followed by the actions possible for that module.</p>
<p>Menu groups can be collapsed to hide the action links, or expanded to reveal all action links in the group. If no action links are visible in a menu group, the group is currently collapsed. Expand the menu group by clicking on the module title, such as My Profile:</p>
<img src='MyProfilecollapsed_en_US.png'/>
<p>Expanding the menu group reveals the action links for View My Profile and Change My Password:</p>
<img src='MyProfileexpanded_en_US.png'/>
<p>Collapse the menu group by clicking on the module title again. This is a toggle-style action, which can be repeated to reveal or hide the action links in the menu groups.
