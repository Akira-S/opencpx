  <p>
    <em type="bold">Caution:</em> Hackers devote a significant amount of money and time to find and decipher passwords. Creating your password as a non-dictionary, alphanumeric combination using upper and lower case letters will go a long way toward protecting your server from such attacks.
  </p>
  <ol title="To change your password: ">
    <li><p>In the My Profile menu group, click <em type="bold">Change My Password</em> (expand the menu group to see the links, if necessary). For more information about expanding and collapsing menu groups, see <a topic='menus_navigation'>Menus and Navigation</a>.</p>
	<p>The Change My Password window appears.</p>
    </li>
    <li>Type your new password in the New Password field.</li>
    <li>Type your new password again in the Confirm Password field.</li>
    <li>Click <em type="bold">Save</em>. A message appears informing you that your changes have been saved.
    </li>
