I've benchmarked using local file accesses versus imap over
localhost. Summary: imapd must do some caching, because for most
"primitive" operations it's somewhat faster than direct filesystem
access, even with network latency (minimal over localhost, though),
authentication, etc. There is one case where local file access is much
faster, which means it's probably a cache buster of some kind (last
test below):

* Reading a 10m message:

localhost/imap:
Total Elapsed Time = 3.226687 Seconds
  User+System Time = 0.016042 Seconds

filesystem:
Total Elapsed Time = 3.508593 Seconds
  User+System Time = 0.391699 Seconds

* Opening and listing 5k messages:

via imap/localhost w/ cachebusting:
Total Elapsed Time = 27.00125 Seconds
  User+System Time = 0.126523 Seconds

via filesystem w/ cachebusting:
Total Elapsed Time = 28.33865 Seconds
  User+System Time = 23.97174 Seconds

via imap/localhost w/ cache:
Total Elapsed Time = 4.809153 Seconds
  User+System Time = 0.067239 Seconds

via filesystem w/ cache:
Total Elapsed Time = 4.083159 Seconds
  User+System Time = 1.083432 Seconds

* Opening, listing, and getting folders' status:

localhost/imap:

  User+System Time = 21.31480 Seconds

* self.pl (folder_list, folder_status(mbox), messages_sort(othermbox))
