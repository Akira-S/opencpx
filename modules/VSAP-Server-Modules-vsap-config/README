NOTES ON CORRUPTION

A long-standing corruption issue existed with cpx.conf due to some
race conditions on the config file. The stressor program finally used
to duplicate these conditions is in t/stress.pl. It requires minor
configuration (but probably cannot be simply run out of the box).

The issue was fixed on 28 Oct 2005 at 11:30a. Be sure you keep a known
good copy of cpx.conf when you run the stressor program.
